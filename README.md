# San Francisco Housing Analysis

Proptech, the application of technology to real-estate markets, is an innovative domain in the fintech industry. I an analyst at a proptech company that wants to offer an instant, one-click service for people to buy properties and then rent them. The company wants to have a trial of this offering in the San Francisco real-estate market. If the service proves popular, they can then expand to other markets.

My main goal is finding properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities.

## Technologies

This project was developed with python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - Providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive.

* [HoloViz (formerly PyViz)](https://pypi.org/project/hvplot/) - Data visualization tools hvPlot and GeoView.

* [pathlib] (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) - This module allows to easily read in csv files.

And as well I used [Jupyter Lab](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook) notebook to develope it.
